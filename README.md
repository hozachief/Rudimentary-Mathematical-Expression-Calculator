# Rudimentary-Mathematical-Expression-Calculator
A simple calculator that solves user provided expressions such as "(5 + 3) * 2" (called infix expression). To avoid ambiguity and to ease the implementation, the program converts an infix expression such as "(5 + 3) * 2" to a postfix expression "5 3 + 2 *". Converting an infix expression to a postfix expression is accomplished with Dijkstra's Shunting Yard algorithm. The program utilizes stack data structures to convert and evaluate an expression. The program utilizes vector data structures, storing vectors of strings to represent individual expressions, where each element of the vector represents a single token. For example, the expression "3.2 * (4.0 / 5.1) + 2" is represented as a vector containing {"3.2", "*", "(", "4.0", "/", "5.1", ")", "+", "2"}. And, after the program evaluates the postfix expression it returns a result.
